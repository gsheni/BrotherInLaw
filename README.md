# PrologPrograms
Prolog program which defines a brother_in_law predicate.
There are two ways to define brother_in_law – the husband of a person’s sister, or the brother of a person’s spouse.  

Some of these predicates should be defined by simple assertions.  

A person cannot be a sibling (brother or sister) to himself or herself.  

Relations in the program as assertions.
